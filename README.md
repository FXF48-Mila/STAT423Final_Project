## Introduction

 Health insurance plays a crucial role in safeguarding individuals and families against the financial burdens associated with healthcare expenses. Especially after Covid-19, "health insurance has become one of the most prominent areas of research." \footnote{(Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning, n.d.)} As medical costs continue to rise and healthcare needs evolve, health insurance charges also increase gradually, after a 4% increase in health insurance in 2023, "American families will face another 4% increase in the cost of private health insurance." \footnote{(ValuePenguin, 2023)} People can't help asking after reading these exposures â€” What are the key factors that affect the health insurance charges? Can I predict next year's charges? How good/credible are these predictive models?

 This report sets out on an exploratory voyage in an effort to solve the mystery surrounding health insurance charges and then give prediction models on the charges. The rest of the report is divided into data, the initial model and its analysis, the alternative model and their analysis, conclusion, and discussion. By delving into these topics, we aim to unravel the factors that influence insurance charges and to fit the regression models capable of accurately predicting health insurance charges.
